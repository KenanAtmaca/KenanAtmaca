### Heey there 👋🏻

Hello, I am an iOS developer who has been developing mobile applications for 10 years. Before that, I had experience in many software languages and 1.5 years in php. Since I stepped into the iOS world, there are +40 market applications, as well as the development process of large-scale companies' applications, as well as many applications that I have written for different customers. Apart from these, I develop myself with +40 Github repos and +600 blog posts and provide resources to other developers. I will always continue to work for better quality and better. I see software not as a job, but as a passion and a great pleasure.
